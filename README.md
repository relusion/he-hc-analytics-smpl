# Homomorphic Encryption POC for Privacy-Preserving Healthcare

This repository contains a simple proof-of-concept project demonstrating how to apply Homomorphic Encryption (HE) in a healthcare scenario using [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL). It encrypts patient data (e.g., glucose, BMI) locally, runs an approximate risk prediction model on the encrypted data, and then decrypts only the final resultâ€”helping to protect sensitive information end-to-end.

## Contents

- **`DiabetesRiskPredictor.cs`**: Core class handling key generation, encryption, homomorphic operations (multiplication, rotation, addition, rescaling), and final decryption.
- **`Program.cs`**: Console application showcasing how to use `DiabetesRiskPredictor` with sample inputs for normal, borderline, and high risk scenarios.
- **Article Reference**: [Privacy-Preserving Healthcare with Homomorphic Encryption](https://medium.com/@vgondarev/privacy-preserving-healthcare-with-homomorphic-encryption-1128f1f1abcf)

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) (8.0 should work as well)
- [Microsoft SEAL NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Research.SEALNet/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/relusion/he-hc-analytics-smpl
   cd he-hc-analytics-smpl/HealthcareAnalytics
   ```

2. **Restore NuGet packages**  

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Build and run**  

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

You should see console output showing approximate risk scores for different glucose/BMI inputs. Here is a typical result:

```
Approx risk for (g=70, bmi=20) => 0.1000
Approx risk for (g=120, bmi=28) => 0.5000
Approx risk for (g=140, bmi=35) => 0.8000
```
